# VBA Stock Market Analysis Challenge

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data across multiple quarters. The script I developed loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs essential information such as the ticker symbol, quarterly changes, percentage changes, and total stock volume. Additionally, I added functionality to identify the stocks with the "Greatest % increase," "Greatest % decrease," and "Greatest total volume."

## Background

This project was part of my journey toward becoming a proficient programmer and Excel expert. It provided me with an opportunity to apply and refine my VBA scripting skills in a real-world scenario, analyzing large datasets with ease and efficiency.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Ticker Symbol Identification:** The script accurately identifies and records the ticker symbols for each stock.
- **Quarterly Change Calculation:** It calculates the quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- **Percentage Change Calculation:** The script computes the percentage change in stock prices over each quarter.
- **Total Stock Volume Calculation:** The total stock volume for each ticker is calculated and displayed.

### Bonus Features
- **Greatest % Increase:** The script identifies the stock with the greatest percentage increase over the quarter.
- **Greatest % Decrease:** It also identifies the stock with the greatest percentage decrease.
- **Greatest Total Volume:** Finally, the stock with the greatest total volume is highlighted.

### Additional Functionality
- **Sheet-Wide Analysis:** The script is designed to run on every worksheet at once, ensuring consistent and accurate analysis across multiple quarters.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Positive changes are highlighted in green, while negative changes are highlighted in red for easy visualization.

## Files Included
- **VBA Script:** The primary script that performs the analysis.
- **Screenshots:** Screenshots showcasing the output of the script for different quarters.
- **README:** This file, providing an overview of the project and its functionalities.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Excel File:** Open the provided Excel file that contains the stock market data.
3. **Run the VBA Script:** Use the built-in VBA editor in Excel to run the script. It will loop through all the worksheets and perform the analysis.
4. **View the Results:** The results, including the calculated changes and the stocks with the greatest changes, will be displayed directly in the Excel file with appropriate conditional formatting.

## Performance Considerations

- **Development Environment:** I used the `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` dataset during development for faster testing. The final script runs efficiently on larger datasets, providing quick and accurate results.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to showcase my ability to automate tedious and repetitive tasks using VBA scripting. By completing this challenge, I have strengthened my skills in data analysis, VBA programming, and Excel automation.
